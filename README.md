JuriNova SmartContracts


This is a basic description of our process, tools and purpose working with SmartContracts. By working alongside our clients, we show them a cheaper, faster and more secure alternative to the regular systems. We want to to expand the use of ETH across our region, in order to improve the issues citizens face daily.

Tools: 

- **OpenLaw** : generate and modify legally binding contracts 
- **Kaleido** : connect the contracts with the Ethereum Network
- **MetaMask** : use to manage and deposit the ETH accorded no said SmartContracts
- **ContractExpress** : validate the content and data of the SmartContracts
- **BlockCat** : auditing SmartContracs

As our research and development increases, we will continue to add more info, examples and descriptions of our process. We are currently running dummy test contracts. Will update once we have more development.
