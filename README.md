JuriNova SmartContracts


This is a basic description of our process, tools and purpose working with SmartContracts. By working alongside our clients, we show them a cheaper, faster and more secure alternative to the regular systems. We want to to expand the use of ETH across our region, in order to improve the issues citizens face daily.

Tools: 
- OpenLaw : generate and modify contracts 
- Kaleido : connect the contracts with the Ethereum Network
- MetaMask: use to manage and deposit the ETH accorded no said contracts
- ContractExpress: validate the content and data of the contracts
